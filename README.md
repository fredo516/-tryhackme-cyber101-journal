## ✅ Current Progress: Cybersecurity 101 Path (In Progress)

### 🧠 Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Learned about threat actors, the CIA triad, and basic attack vectors
- Explored malware types and common vulnerabilities

### 🌐 Networking Fundamentals
- Studied the OSI model and TCP/IP layers
- Practiced identifying common ports and services (e.g., SSH, HTTP, DNS)
- Used **Wireshark** to analyze real packet captures and detect traffic patterns

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
- Navigated the Linux terminal (Red Hat–based systems)
- Practiced creating/modifying files, managing directories, using `chmod`/`chown`
- Explored user and group permissions

### 🪟 Windows Fundamentals
- Investigated Windows services, Task Manager, and regedit
- Analyzed processes and file structures used in real-world systems

### 🏢 Active Directory Basics
- Gained understanding of domain structure, authentication, and group policy
- Explored enumeration tools for discovering AD objects

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Complete Attacking AD section
- Begin Blue Team tools & SOC lab scenarios
- Build sample tickets from simulated Help Desk scenarios
