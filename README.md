## ✅ Current Progress: Cybersecurity 101 Path (In Progress)

### 🧠 Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Learned about threat actors, the CIA triad, and basic attack vectors
- Explored malware types and common vulnerabilities

### 🌐 Networking Fundamentals
- Studied the OSI model and TCP/IP layers
- Practiced identifying common ports and services (e.g., SSH, HTTP, DNS)
- Used **Wireshark** to analyze real packet captures and detect traffic patterns

### 🐧 Linux Fundamentals
- Navigated the Linux terminal (Red Hat–based systems)
- Practiced creating/modifying files, managing directories, using `chmod`/`chown`
- Explored user and group permissions

### 🪟 Windows Fundamentals
- Investigated Windows services, Task Manager, and regedit
- Analyzed processes and file structures used in real-world systems

### 🏢 Active Directory Basics
- Gained understanding of domain structure, authentication, and group policy
- Explored enumeration tools for discovering AD objects

---

### 🏢 Active Directory (Completed)
- Explored the structure and role of Active Directory within Windows-based networks
- Learned how authentication, domain controllers, users, and groups operate within AD
- Practiced enumerating AD information using tools like `rpcclient`, `enum4linux`, and `nmap`
- Simulated real-world attacker enumeration techniques against misconfigured AD environments
- Gained understanding of concepts like Kerberos, LDAP, and Group Policy Objects (GPO)

🛠 Tools used:
- `rpcclient`
- `enum4linux`
- `nmap`
- AD-based virtual lab environment (TryHackMe)

🎯 Skills Gained:
- Domain enumeration and reconnaissance
- Identifying vulnerable user accounts and misconfigured shares
- Understanding authentication protocols and privilege escalation paths within AD
